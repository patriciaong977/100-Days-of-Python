# Coding Exercises

This folder consists of interactive coding exercises that were completed during each day of the course.

## [Day 1 ✅](https://github.com/patriciaong977/100-Days-of-Python/tree/master/Interactive%20Coding%20Exercises/Day%201)

1. Printing - Write a program in main.py that prints the same notes from the previous lesson using what you have learnt about the Python print function.
2. Debugging Practice - Look at the code in the code editor on the right. There are errors in all of the lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.
3. Input Function - Write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name. You might need to Google for a function that calculates the length of a string.
4. Variables - Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.

## [Day 2 ✅](https://github.com/patriciaong977/100-Days-of-Python/tree/master/Interactive%20Coding%20Exercises/Day%202)

1. Data Types - Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
2. BMI Calculator - Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.
3. Life in Weeks - Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

## [Day 3 ✅](https://github.com/patriciaong977/100-Days-of-Python/tree/master/Interactive%20Coding%20Exercises/Day%203)

1. Odd or Even - Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.
2. BMI 2.0 - Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
3. Leap Year - Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year.
4. Pizza Order Practice - Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza. Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program. Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
5. Love Calculator - You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

## [Day 4 ✅](https://github.com/patriciaong977/100-Days-of-Python/tree/master/Interactive%20Coding%20Exercises/Day%204)

1. Heads or Tails - You are going to write a virtual coin toss program. It will randomly tell the user "Heads" or "Tails".
2. Banker Roulette - You are going to write a program that will select a random name from a list of names. The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.
3. Treasure Map - You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

## [Day 5 ✅](https://github.com/patriciaong977/100-Days-of-Python/tree/master/Interactive%20Coding%20Exercises/Day%205)

1. Average Height - You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
2. High Score - You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.
3. Adding Even Numbers - You are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100: i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100
4. Fizz Buzz - You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game:
   - Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.
   - When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".
   - When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`
   - And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

## [Day 8 ✅](https://github.com/patriciaong977/100-Days-of-Python/tree/master/Interactive%20Coding%20Exercises/Day%208)

1. Paint Area Calculator - You are painting a wall. The instructions on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
   - Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.number of cans = (wall height ✖️ wall width) ÷ coverage per can.
     e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5
     number of cans = (2 ✖️ 4) ÷ 5 = 1.6
   - But because you can't buy 0.6 of a can of paint, the result should be rounded up to 2 cans.
2. Prime Numbers - You need to write a function that checks whether if the number passed into it is a prime number or not.
   - e.g. 2 is a prime number because it's only divisible by 1 and 2.
   But 4 is not a prime number because you can divide it by 1, 2 or 4.

## Day 9

1. Grading Program - Write a program that converts their scores to grades. By the end of your program, you should have a new dictionary called student_grades that should contain student names for keys and their grades for values. The final version of the student_grades dictionary will be checked.
    - This is the scoring criteria:
      Scores 91 - 100: Grade = "Outstanding"
      Scores 81 - 90: Grade = "Exceeds Expectations"
      Scores 71 - 80: Grade = "Acceptable"
      Scores 70 or lower: Grade = "Fail"

2. Dictionary in List - You are going to write a program that adds to a travel_log. You can see a travel_log which is a List that contains 2 Dictionaries.

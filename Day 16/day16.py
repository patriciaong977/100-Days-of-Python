# Object Oriented Programming
  # Separating each task/class separately, and becomes more reusable, readable, maintainable, and scalable for larger projects.

# Procedural Programming - A way of programming that focuses
#       on writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data,
#       rather than on describing the data itself.

# How to use OOP.
# Using the Restaurant Example.
  # You need: (CLASS)
  # 1. Chef
  # 2. Waiter (object) - can have multiple waiters/multiple objects.
  # 3. Cleaner
  # 4. Manager
# For each of these, (Waiter)
  #   1. ATTRIBUTES (variables) -  you need to know what it has,
        # is_holding_plate = True
        # tables_responsible = [4,5,6]
  #   2. METHODS (functions) - and what it does.
        # def take_order(table, order):
          # takes order to chef
        # take_payment(amount):
          # add money to restaurant

# Pascal case - each word starts with a capital letter. (Class names)
# Object | CLASS
#  car = CarBlueprint()
# car is created from CarBlueprint class.


#### Notes ####
# Object Attributes
# Car attributes: speed = 0, fuel = 32

# How to access attributes
# car.speed
# car is object, speed is attribute.
# Access object, then attribute.

# Object Methods - functions tied to an object. (Methods are functions)
# Car methods:
# def move():
#   speed = 60

# def stop():
#   speed = 0

# Python Packages - a whole bunch of modules.

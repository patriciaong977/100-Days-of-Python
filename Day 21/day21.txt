# Day 21: Class Inheritance, Slicing

Chef Class | Pastry Chef Class
bake()     | bake()
stir()     | stir()
measure()  | measure()
           | knead()
           | whisk()

Class inheritance:
- Inherit Apperance = Attributes
- Inherit Behavior = Methods
- Inherit Identity = Class Name

Inheritance:
class Fish(Animal): # Name of the class = Fish, Name of the parent/super class = Animal
  def __init__(self):
   super().__init__() # Call the __init__() method of the parent/super class

! Look into day21.py for examples.

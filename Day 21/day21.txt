# Day 21: Class Inheritance, Slicing

Chef Class | Pastry Chef Class
bake()     | bake()
stir()     | stir()
measure()  | measure()
           | knead()
           | whisk()

Class inheritance:
- Inherit Apperance = Attributes
- Inherit Behavior = Methods
- Inherit Identity = Class Name

Inheritance:
class Fish(Animal): # Name of the class = Fish, Name of the parent/super class = Animal
  def __init__(self):
   super().__init__() # Call the __init__() method of the parent/super class

! Look into day21.py for examples.


Slicing:
piano_keys = a b c d e f g
            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

piano_keys[2:5] # c d e
Slices the list from index 2 to 4 (5 - 1)

The third number sets the increment.
Slice from pos 2 to 5, but only get every other item.
piano_keys[2:5:2] # c e

Get everything on the list but only want every second item.
piano_keys[::2] # a c e g

Can specify a negative number to start from the end of the list.
piano_keys[::-1] # g

# 100-Days-of-Python

This Repository is composed of my notes while learning python using Dr. Angela Yu's course called 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022.

Link to the course: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/.

I decided to learn more about python on top of my current knowledge to enhance my skills as a programmer and also to refresh the knowledge that I've already gained from self-studying.

# Folder Organization
I organized my notes by the day that they were discussed on the course, each in its own folder.

The Mini Project folder consists of the projects that were assigned each day.

The Resources folder consists of resources that the course provided only on day 1.

# Progress
### Day 2 (Completed) / Day 100
